## Mutli-Single-Page web application?

At that time, I was thinking about a "Multi-Single-Page" web application, putting multiple single-page web applications into a statically-served directory. That's kind of an interesting thought, and it worked. I think that design might be good for team cooperation and project management in general since one part of the page doesn't necessarily depend on another part of the website, and all of the components don't need to be built in one compilation.

## Graph Visualizations

I was also thinking about how to illustrate and display the graphs I have visualized. This layout design is kind of simple but effective.

## San Context: Multi-Scene Single Canvas Design

The San Context provides a lot of convenience for the "Mutli-Scene" Single Canvas design. It's super convenient!!! The San Context in this directory is a primitive version, not considering the problem of time elapsed (not a big deal). I think the destruction of Three geometries and materials and updating the scene should be the work of individual "scenes", but I haven't considered it.
