# Learning Computer Science

This is Zhifeng's repository trying to archive some of his solved programming challenges in a somewhat structured way.

Since the August of 2022, I started to solve Leetcode daily questions for practice, fun, and expanding my horizon. Those delicate and beautiful ideas from Competitive Programming always attract me. Although Leetcode is not that "competitive programming", comparing to SPOJ or others, I think it is still a good start for me to approach those knowledge of Computer Science.

## The first sweet taste

Although I guess my first sweet taste of learning Computer Science can be traced back long before this experience I'm writing about. It could be dated back to the years of using Minecraft command blocks and studying Scratch.

My first sweet taste was about solving a problem about counting parallelograms. I first tried to loop though the points and check if the four points forms a parallelogram. That lead to a "Time Limit Exceeded". Then, I tried to loop through all pairs of three points, checking if the last point exists. That still led to a "Time Limit Exceeded." Finally, I tried to loop through all pairs of points of two, recording the mid point and the slope of the points and finally got accepted.

# Previous Attempt:

Previously, I tried to use another repository [(link)](https://github.com/zf-w/Learn-CS-Old) to archive those solved problems. I have added my thoughts on each problem into the root README file, but I found that's a somewhat unmanageable way in the long term. In addition, I didn't have a way to actually run those C++ codes in the previous repository.
