description: "The notes of my previous mini-projects. Reviewing back, I did try to learn a bunch of stuff and experiment with various ideas. From 2013 to 2023, thoughts after thoughts, I felt I hardly stopped trying to realize my ideas. Although those steps are super small, recording them is also fun."

# Zhifeng's Computer Science Learning Playground

## Basic Idea

This repository archives some ancient and strange scripts I have written. When I first wrote down this exact sentence, 2023-11-24, I felt like I should keep all those codes for preservation? reproducibility? I guess maybe I want to preserve the changes in my coding styles, interests, and developing personality.

# Mini Projects

## Learning Computer Science 2022-Present

I'm trying to archive all the solved problems from various of Online Judges in a somewhat sturctured way.

Since the August of 2022, I started to solve Leetcode daily questions for practice, fun, and expanding my horizon. Those delicate and beautiful ideas from Competitive Programming always attract me. Although Leetcode is not that "competitive programming", comparing to SPOJ and many others, I think it is still a good start for me to approach those knowledge of Computer Science.

## React-GraphGallery 2023 Summer

[Github link](https://github.com/zf-w/zf-w/tree/main/Toys/React-GraphGallery/)

This project is about a single-page web app with pagination displaying the graphs I have visualized. Based on my current understanding, I feel this project is kind of a milestone. Since this project, I have understood how web pages work more. A web application doesn't have to be either multi-paged with a server returning rendered HTML files or single-paged with Javascript in-browser navigation. There can be a multi-single-page web application.

## ReactThree-1111Game 2023 Spring

[Github link](https://github.com/zf-w/zf-w/tree/main/Toys/ReactThree-1111Game)

This mini project is about a simple game visualization of a game called (I think) "one plus one" or "left-right hand." In this project, I was learning how to bind Three.js 3D objects with 2D React components and their states.

## Angular-IS100Prototype 2021 Fall

[Github link](https://github.com/zf-w/zf-w/tree/main/Toys/Angular-IS100Prototype)

Those scripts are from the year 2021, the first year of my university education. The course required me to make a project about human-centered design. So, I used Github pages to publish a tiny demo of a small blog. I remember that my classmates were shocked because they only had some images of their prototype designs, instead of a QR code that was truly accessible (but the content is still poor, hahahaha).

## Python-Fractal 2018 Fall

[Github link](https://github.com/zf-w/zf-w/tree/main/Toys/Python-Fractal)

Those scripts are from the year 2018 when I finally entered high school and started to have more and more dedicated time to learn about programming. I really enjoy using fractals to feel and intuitively learn how recursion works.

## Matplotlib-ThreeBody 2018 Fall

[Github link](https://github.com/zf-w/zf-w/tree/main/Toys/Matplotlib-ThreeBody)

Those scripts are from the year 2018, when I finally entered high school and started to have more and more dedicated time to learn how to program. Throughout that project, I gained some intuitions and ideas about Matplotlib and Python.
