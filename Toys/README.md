# Zhifeng's Computer Science Learning Playground

This repository archives some ancient and inactive scripts I have written.

## React-GraphGallery 2023 Summer [link](Toys/React-GraphGallery/)

This project is about a single-page web app with pagination displaying the graphs I have visualized. Based on my current understanding, I feel this project is kind of a milestone. Since this project, I have understood how web pages work more. A web application doesn't have to be either multi-paged with a server returning rendered HTML files or single-paged with Javascript in-browser navigation. There can be a multi-single-page web application.

## ReactThree-1111Game 2023 Spring [link](Toys/ReactThree-1111Game)

This mini project is about a simple game visualization of a game called (I think) "one plus one" or "left right hand." In this project, I was learning how to bind Three.js 3D object with 2D React components and their states.

## Angular-IS100Prototype 2021 Fall [link](Toys/Angular-IS100Prototype)

Those scripts are from the year 2021, the first year of my university education. The course required me to make a project about human-centered design. So, I used Github pages to publish a tiny demo of a small blog. I remember that my classmates were shocked because they only had some images of their prototype designs, instead of a QR code that was truly accessible (but the content is still poor, hahahaha).

## Python-Fractal 2018 Fall [link](Toys/Python-Fractal)

Those scripts are from the year 2018 when I finally entered high school and started to have more and more dedicated time to learn about programming. I really enjoy using fractals to feel and intuitively learn how recursion works.

## Matplotlib-ThreeBody 2018 Fall [link](Toys/Matplotlib-ThreeBody)

Those scripts are from the year 2018, when I finally entered high school and started to have more and more dedicated time to learn how to program. Throughout that project, I gained some intuitions and ideas about Matplotlib and Python.
